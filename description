I created this pipeline for a school purpose.
  We had to choose a ML model
  and create a pipeline from scratch

This pipeline is only working with the NBA data available on https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/ 
also available https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L-cMcsmksmkGcWBqszUhzIDM6u7RLlsy

if you want to download the files directly.

The project aim to automatically train a model when we had a new file.

to make the application runnable on all devices, we dockerise the pipeline and the visualisation.

You can test the project directly by installing and running the docker-compose file
